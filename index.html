            <h1>Ford Mustang</h1>
            <div class="text2">Ford Mustang is a cult pony car produced by Ford Motor Company. The car does not have a Ford emblem, but a special Mustang emblem.
                The initial version 11233 was created on the basis of units of the Ford Falcon family sedan.
                The first production Mustang rolled off the assembly line on March 9, 1964 as a 1965 model.
                On April 17, the car was presented to the public in New York, and on April 19, it was shown on all three American television networks.
                The promotion of the car was accompanied by an active advertising campaign. It was one of the most successful premieres in the history of automobile manufacturing.</div>
